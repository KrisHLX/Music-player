# Music Player 


Hey there!  
This is my **Web Music Player** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It’s a responsive browser-based app where you can play, pause, seek, and control music—plus manage playlists.

## 🧠 Tech Used

- Progress bar syncs with song playback.
- Volume slider changes `audio.volume`.
